01-31-09 Version 2.26 released.
01-31-09 param_bool and param_int erroneously returned double.  Changed to int.

01-19-09 Version 2.25 released.
01-19-09 Changed expand-thread.pl so that lstart and lend are set when
         threads are created rather than every time thread is told to start.
01-11-09 psidot.conf and psidot-vl.conf changed to be one big addition
         rather than lots of +=.
01-11-09 Changed lapack/diagonalize-sym.c so that ldwork is calculated
         rather than set at 1024.

01-04-09 Version 2.24 released.
01-04-09 Added param_ignore("nr_threads") to spherical.c, so that errant
         "nr_threads" in the paramters file does not generate an error.
01-04-09 Put all code for allowing different initial states of psi into
         a directory called "init."  Right now, this code is not satisfactory
         because of the problem if any eigenvalue of the initial second
         moment tensor is less than 0.2.
01-03-09 Added warning if the initial state of psi does not represent a
         genuine probability distribution.
01-03-09 Removed all references to "allocate" - put mallocs explicitly
         into the code.
01-02-09 Made asking for more than one type of diffusion cause an error.
01-02-09 Made parsing of parameters file more robust.
01-02-09 Added to spherical.c capacity to enter initial state of psi.
01-02-09 Corrected: spherical.c would use Adams Bash 4 when asked to do RK 4.

01-01-09 Version 2.23 released.
01-01-09 Corrected error in ode-adams-bash-4.c.
01-01-09 Updated copyright notices to include 2009.
12-31-08 In ode-adams-bash-4.c, considered storage of old diffs done via
         pointers rather than copying data.  But it didn't seem to effect
         speed of program very much.  So it is indicated as a possibility
         in the comments, but not implemented.
12-31-08 Various cleanups, including adding "else" to derivs in spherical.c.
12-31-08 Made allocate and allocate_many into macros.
12-30-08 Added a pthread_mutex_unlock and lock around a pthread_cond_broadcast
         in programs generated by expand-thread.pl.  It doesn't seem to
         change functionality at all, but it does seem to me that it shouldn't
         have worked in its previous state.

12-29-08 Version 2.22 released.
12-29-08 Added two methods for solving the ODE: Adams-Bashforth of order 4,
         and Runge-Kutta of order 4.
         Changed parameters-jef.txt to use Adams-Bashforth of order 4, and
         made step size 10 times bigger.
12-27-08 In spherical.c x->psi and dx->psidot.  Explained that psi is
         actually sqrt(4 pi) times the spherical harmonic coefficients.

12-22-08 Version 2.21 released.
12-19-08 Fixed bug in expand-method.pl (it used to be that an expression
         like x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x+x would cause an "unknown symbol" error.)
12-18-08 Small cleanups.
12-18-08 Made error handling more robust: expand-method.pl now outputs an
         error message without dying; expand-iterate.pl is slightly more
         informative when it dies with an error.
12-17-08 Added parameters-koch-el.txt to illustrate that the Koch diffusion
         term is elliptic as long as C2 and C3 exceed -C1.
12-17-08 Changed spherical.m so now it should work with Matlab as well as
         octave.

12-16-08 Version 2.20 released.
12-16-08 Cleaned up the threading code a little, in expand-thread.pl.
12-16-08 Cosmetic changes "Declarations of threading" ->
         "Declarations of threading go here." in expand-iterate.pl.
12-16-08 Cosmetic changes to USAGE.tex.
12-15-08 Cosmetic changes to ode-adams-bash.c.
12-15-08 Changed lapack/diagonalize-sym.c so that it doesn't use cfortran.h.
12-15-08 Moved rsc.tex to misc.
12-14-08 spherical.c now outputs a_12 by default.
12-14-08 Created parameters-koch-C3.txt, parameters-koch-vf0.01.txt,
         parameters-koch-vf0.05.txt.  Removed parameters-koch.txt.

12-10-08 Version 2.19 released.
12-10-08 Update to USAGE.tex to emphasize that nabla denotes gradient onto
         tangent space of sphere.
12-09-08 Made expand-method.pl die if brackets are used and TENSOR=1.  This
         is because results are unreliable otherwise.
12-08-08 Added Copyright in source of spherical.c, so that the copyright
         notice will appear when "strings" is applied to the binaries.
12-08-08 Also placed psidot-al and psidot-mg into test-stuff.  They are failed
         models.  psidot-al is useful as it can be checked against
         the monte-carlo simulations - also now placed into test-stuff.
12-08-08 Added a "sanity check" to psidot-koch, which allows one to check
         the computations against the 2nd order tensor formulae.  The required
         files are placed in the directory test-stuff.  A similar test could be
         performed for ARD.
12-07-08 Changed multiplication back to right to left.  It only makes a
         difference if TENSOR=1, but it is a necessary difference in that
         situation.  (Work arounds are possible, but I decided not to fight
         it.)
12-07-08 Changed multiplication of operators so it is evaluated left to right
         in expand-method.pl.
12-07-08 Redid diagonalize.c to add "eval" explicitly to return values.  Moved
         function collapse directly into rsc.c.  No changes to functionality.
12-05-08 Thinking about using lapack to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
         It is quite hard to link with fortran, and in particular could not
         figure out how to cross compile to windows.
         So put the changes into a new directory called lapack, but will
         default to the original diagonalize-sym.c that uses Jacobi method.

12-04-08 Version 2.18 released.
12-04-08 Removed ilx, ily, ilz from expand-method.pl.  Now only lx, ly, lz.
12-04-08 Correction to expand-method.pl (addition and subtraction was not done
         left to right).
12-04-08 Corrections to psidot-koch and psidot-ard (dx*dy is not dy*dx).

12-03-08 Version 2.17 released.
12-02-08 Added reverse-tensor.pl to create reverse-tensor.c.
12-02-08 Changes to documentation, mostly d/dx -> nabla_x, etc.

12-01-08 Version 2.16 released.
12-01-08 Corrected sign error in expand-method.c.  Signs of lm and lp were
         incorrect.  (Complex conj(lp) = -lm.)
12-01-08 Corrected mistakes in reverse_tensor.c.  This had caused the rsc
         method to work very incorrectly.
11-30-08 Rewrote expand-method.pl.  It is now more robust and allows more
         complicated formulae (e.g. brackets).  Added I, lx, ly, lz and lap.
         Also added ability to set variables.
         Removed the complications from make-tensor.pl (it used to remember
         intermediate results).

11-29-08 Version 2.15 released.
11-29-08 Added rudimentary error checking to expand-method.pl, so at least it
         dies if rubbish is entered.
11-29-08 Added a third coefficient to psidot-koch, to give it a kind of
         "angular momentum" type diffusion.

11-28-08 Version 2.14 released.
11-28-08 Made changes to USAGE.tex to reflect changes made to psidot-koch
         and psidot.ard.  I am now rather more sure that the corrections
         are proper.
11-26-08 Huge bug in psidot-koch and psidot-ard.  Basically I did not
         properly appreciate that grad_p is not anti-symmetric on the
         sphere.  The  spotting of this mistake was hugely inspired by
         reading the ARD paper of Phelps and Tucker.  Made corrections,
         but I must admit to being a bit unsure as to whether it is now
         correct.
11-26-08 Added more to rsc.tex.
11-25-08 Added remark about "flux" to rsc.tex.

11-22-08 Version 2.13 released.
11-21-08 Added ARD model of Phelps and Tucker Phelps, called psidot-ard.
11-21-08 Charles Tucker gave us permission to use their patented model for
         research and educational use.  The license message in rsc.c is
         modified accordingly.  Also added checking the environment variable
         MAY_USE_PATENT_7266469 to rsc.c.
11-21-08 wot changed to rsc throughout.

11-16-08 Version 2.12 released.
11-16-08 Added experimental psidot-al - work in progress.  Checked with
         the programs monte-carlo-al.c and monte-carlo-al.nb.
11-13-08 Corrected another huge mistake in psidot-dd and psidot-dd-2.
         Various variables were declared double that should have been declared
         COMPLEX.  These errors were found through experiences in creating
         psidot-al.
11-13-08 Corrected huge mistake in psidot-dd and psidot-dd-2.  They had
         computed the Laplacian and multiplied by Dr in the wrong order.
         This was correcting the correction of 10-24-08 (that is, it was 
         correct before 10-24-08).
11-12-08 Rewrote expand-iterate.pl and expand-thread.pl so that it could
         handle several @spherical_iterate's in one file.
         Removed lap-psi and put the functionality into psidot-dd and
         psidot-dd-2.

11-11-08 Version 2.11 released.
11-11-08 Added experimental psidot-mg - work in progress.
11-11-08 Added license interrogation to wot.
11-10-08 Wrote USAGE.tex.  Removed diffusions.tex.

11-08-08 Version 2.10 released.
11-08-08 Removed Makefile-ming32.
         Created make-tar-zip.sh which creates the .exe files.
11-07-08 Completely rewrote expand-iterate.pl to create unthreaded programs.
         Threading is now done separately by expand-thread.pl.
         thread-routines.c removed, now directly written into the code.
11-06-08 Mildly rewrote the diffusions.tex and wot.tex.
11-01-08 Added "-v<number>" as alternative to "-v <number>" to command line
         options,

10-30-08 Version 2.09 released.
10-29-08 Added psidot-wot - implementation of Wang-O'Gara-Tucker scale
         reduction factor.

10-28-08 Version 2.08 released.
10-28-08 Corrected mistake "double dd_vl".
10-28-08 Allowed do_vl and do_fd to take values 1 or 2.
10-28-08 Removed alpha and beta from fractional diffusion - renamed it
         "variable diffusion" psidot-vd.

10-27-08 Version 2.07 released.
10-27-08 Added "variable lambda" - psidot-vl.

10-26-08 Version 2.06 released.
10-26-08 Replaced psidot-dd-3 by psidot-fd, "fractional diffusion."

10-26-08 Version 2.05 released.
10-26-08 Added psidot-dd-3, a third directional diffusion.

10-25-08 Version 2.04 released.
10-24-08 Added psidot-dd-2, a different directional diffusion.
10-24-08 Corrected psidot-dd, necessitating addition of lap-psi.

10-20-08 Version 2.03 released.
10-20-08 Removed check for parameter CI when do_koch or do_dd is set.
10-20-08 Added directional diffusion (psidot-dd).
10-19-08 expand-iterate.pl modified to deal with common code.  psidot-koch.conf
modified to take advantage of common code.  The idea here is that the different
threads shouldn't have to separately recompute common computations.
10-19-08 spherical.c now prints out nr_threads if set by the environment
variable NR_THREADS when verbose output is asked for.

10-19-08 Version 2.02 released.
10-19-08 Added Makefile-mingw32 to cross compile from FreeBSD to Windows.
All *.txt files have "carriage returns" added at the end of lines, so that
Notepad in Windows can properly handle them.
10-19-08 Added "number" to -v option, to indicate frequency of displaying
output to terminal.
10-19-08 Added print_aij, print_aijkl, print_aijklmn options to the
possible parameters.  Showcased in parameters-ft-fullprint.txt.
